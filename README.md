## Components & sketches tox

These are some comps for common patterns I created to speed up my work flow, as well as some sketches I made.

### CHOPs.tox
**Compare** 
/n
An OP that compare the two inputs, if the second input is not provided then the parameter Cuttoff is used.
/n
**Compare_2CH**
/n
Similar to Compare, but operates on two channels indivually.
/n
**Customs_Fps**
/n
An OP that returns the frame count at a custom framerate, used for effects that updates at a different frame rate than main.
/n
**Multi_Swtich_Index**
An OP that returns the index that wraps around 0-(length-1), increments when a pulse is given to the input. Usually used with any kind of Switch OP.
